    "\n",
    "In this project, you will act as consultants for ABCDEats Inc. (ABCDE), a fictional food delivery service partner- ing with a range of restaurants to offer diverse meal options. Your task is to analyse customer data collected over three months from three cities to help ABCDE develop a data-driven strategy tailored to various customer segments. The description of the data is provided under the Dataset Description section of this document. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend segmenting customers using multiple perspectives. Examples of segmentation perspec- tives include value-based segmentation, which groups customers by their economic value; preference or behaviour-based segmentation which focuses on purchasing habits; and demographic segmentation which categorises customers by attributes like age, gender, and income to understand different interaction pat- terns. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the company seeks a final segmentation that integrates these perspectives to enable them to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy."
