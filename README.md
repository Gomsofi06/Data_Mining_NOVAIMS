## <center>*ABCDEats Inc*</center>

In this project, you will act as consultants for ABCDEats Inc. (ABCDE), a fictional food delivery service partner- ing with a range of restaurants to offer diverse meal options. Your task is to analyse customer data collected over three months from three cities to help ABCDE develop a data-driven strategy tailored to various customer segments. The description of the data is provided under the Dataset Description section of this document. <br>

We recommend segmenting customers using multiple perspectives. Examples of segmentation perspec- tives include value-based segmentation, which groups customers by their economic value; preference or behaviour-based segmentation which focuses on purchasing habits; and demographic segmentation which categorises customers by attributes like age, gender, and income to understand different interaction pat- terns. <br>

Ultimately, the company seeks a final segmentation that integrates these perspectives to enable them to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy.

### Parte I
Expected Outcomes:
* Conduct an in-depth exploration of the dataset. Summarise key statistics for the data, and discuss their possible implications.
* Identifyanytrends,patterns,oranomalieswithin the dataset. Explore relationships between fea- tures.
* Create new features that may help enhance your analysis.
* Use visualisations to effectively communicate your findings. 

### Parte II
Expected Outcomes:
* Preprocess the data. Invest time into evaluat- ing your preprocessing pipeline, explaining the choices you made and the advantages and disad- vantages of different decisions.
* Justify the clustering approach. Determine and provide a rationale for the clustering solution, in- cluding the number of clusters, that you decide to use.
* Explain the clusters in your final segmentation. Analyse and describe the characteristics of each group, taking into account the perspectives you used. Create profiles that highlight the distin- guishing features of each cluster.
* Suggest business applications. Based on your in- sights, define general marketing approaches for each cluster.
