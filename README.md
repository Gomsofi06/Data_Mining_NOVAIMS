# Data_Mining_2425
Project for the Data Mining class of the Master in Data Science at NOVA IMS. <br>

Made in colaboration with Marta Boavida, Jan-Louis Schneider, Matilde Miguel. <br>

## ABCDEats Inc.

In this project, you will act as consultants for ABCDEats Inc. (ABCDE), a fictional food delivery service partner- ing with a range of restaurants to offer diverse meal options. Your task is to analyse customer data collected over three months from three cities to help ABCDE develop a data-driven strategy tailored to various customer segments. The description of the data is provided under the Dataset Description section of this document. <br>

We recommend segmenting customers using multiple perspectives. Examples of segmentation perspec- tives include value-based segmentation, which groups customers by their economic value; preference or behaviour-based segmentation which focuses on purchasing habits; and demographic segmentation which categorises customers by attributes like age, gender, and income to understand different interaction pat- terns. <br>

Ultimately, the company seeks a final segmentation that integrates these perspectives to enable them to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy.
